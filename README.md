# PsychicHttp - HTTP on your ESP ðŸ§™ðŸ”®

PsychicHttp is a webserver library for ESP32 + Arduino framework which uses the ESP-IDF HTTP Server library under the hood.  It is written in a similar style to the [Arduino WebServer](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/tree/master/libraries/WebServer), [ESPAsyncWebServer](https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer), and [ArduinoMongoose](https://github.com/jeremypoulter/ArduinoMongoose) to make writing code simple and porting from those other libraries straightforward.

# Features

* Asynchronous approach (server running in its own FreeRTOS thread)
* Handles all HTTP methods with lots of helper functions:
    * GET/POST parameters
    * get/set headers
    * get/set cookies
    * basic key/value session data storage
    * authentication (basic and digest mode)
* Websocket support with onConnect, onFrame, and onClose callbacks
* HTTPS / SSL support
* Static fileserving (SPIFFS, LittleFS, etc.)
* Chunked response
* File uploads (Basic, no multipart... yet)
* No templating system
* No url rewriting
* No Async Event Source
* No AP/STA filter

# v1.0 Release TODO:

* fix the authdigest issues
* get library in arduino library manager
* get library on platformio
* make a release script
* update docs / readme
* post on forums

# Roadmap:

* investigate websocket performance gap
* multipart file uploads
* support for esp-idf framework
* support for arduino 3.0 framework
* Enable worker based multithreading with esp-idf v5.x
  * #if ESP_ARDUINO_VERSION_MAJOR >= 3
* 100-continue support
* 'borrow' other nice features from ESPAsyncServer and Arduino WebServer
    * https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer
      * AP/STA filter
